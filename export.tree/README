We present an MRI dataset of 85 people with epilepsy due to focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II and 85 healthy controls. 
In epilepsy imaging, automated detection of FCDs plays a vital role because FCDs often escape conventional MRI analysis. Accurate recognition of FCDs is essential for affected patients. Surgical resection of the dysplastic cortex is associated with a high success rate, and a substantial number of patients subsequently become seizure-free. 
We hope this dataset's publication will improve computer-aided FCD detection by enabling the validation of existing algorithms or aiding the development of new approaches. 
Our dataset includes MRI data from T1 and FLAIR weighted images, manually labeled lesion masks, and selected clinical features.
